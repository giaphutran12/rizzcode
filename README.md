# RizzCode

RizzCode is LeetCode-style practice for dating and grounded social fluency. This
GPT comparison build implements the approved MVP contract in
[docs/RIZZCODE_MASTER_PLAN.md](docs/RIZZCODE_MASTER_PLAN.md) while preserving
the Taste visual direction.

## What is implemented

- Four-question onboarding, skip path, personalized starting module, two skill
  priorities, Growth Direction, and one optional Side Quest
- Spark and Connection curriculum with all ten scenarios available immediately
- Exactly ten playable In Person and Messaging scenarios
- Three to six user-authored turns, with earlier persona or boundary exits
- Server-side adaptive persona reactions using `gpt-5-nano` by default
- Messaging draft preparation after five idle seconds, plus Sent, Delivered,
  Seen, and persona typing states
- Server-only LLM judge using Vercel AI SDK v6, `@ai-sdk/openai`, Zod,
  `generateText()`, and `Output.object()`
- Five evidence-backed rubric criteria, deterministic gates and arithmetic, and
  FUMBLED, COOKED, or ATE verdicts
- Likely simulated outcomes, improved-response coaching, XP, levels, streaks,
  personal bests, achievements, and recommended next reps
- Demo leaderboard choice A using practice XP only
- Private self-reported real-world milestones that add zero public XP
- Versioned local persistence, isolated corrupt-record recovery, storage
  warnings, judge retry, unknown-route handling, and authored persona fallback
- Responsive and keyboard-usable product views at mobile, tablet, and desktop
  sizes, with reduced-motion support

The historical `/control` and `/compare` prototype routes remain available as
visual references. They are not the production product path.

## Run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a private `.env.local` in this worktree:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside `.env.local`. The optional
`RIZZCODE_PERSONA_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-5-nano`; the separate
`RIZZCODE_JUDGE_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-5.4`.

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173).

To use the existing ignored environment file in the original checkout without
copying it:

```bash
set -a
source /Users/edwardtran/side-projects/leetcode-for-dating/.env.local
set +a
npm run dev
```

The shell loads that file for the process only. It never prints or sends the key
to the browser. Without a server-side key, persona turns use labeled authored
fallbacks, while official judgment remains unscored and offers `Retry
judgment`.

## Verification

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run check
npm run build
```

The Playwright suite starts the server with server-boundary mock persona and
judge providers. It checks the full first-visit flow, bounded adaptive turns,
double-submit prevention, open scenario access, idle draft preparation,
Sent/Delivered/Seen states, persistence after refresh, Messaging mode, unknown
routes, judge failure, and 375px, 768px, and 1440px layouts.

An opt-in live provider smoke test is available:

```bash
RIZZCODE_ENV_FILE=/absolute/path/to/.env.local npm run test:live-judge
```

It prints only pass or failure metadata, never the credential or transcript.

## Runtime architecture

- Next.js 16 App Router serves the product through
  `src/app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`.
- `src/app/api/[...path]/route.ts` owns `POST /api/persona/prepare`,
  `POST /api/persona`, and `POST /api/judge` in one Node route module.
- `server/persona/` owns prompt-safe adaptive generation, draft preparation,
  idempotency, authored fallback, and the bounded canonical conversation store.
- `server/runtime.ts` selects production or non-production test providers
  without exposing environment variables to the client.
- `server/judge/provider.ts` is the only production provider path.
- `server/judge/service.ts` requires the server-owned conversation, runs hard
  gates, invokes the separate judge provider, validates evidence and outcomes,
  recalculates scores, applies caps, and derives the verdict.
- `src/engine/conversationEngine.ts` owns client-visible attempt transitions,
  action rendering, delivery states, and authored fallback behavior.
- `src/domain/` owns pure scoring, XP, onboarding, validation, and next-rep
  logic.
- `src/storage/stores.ts` owns the four versioned local records.

Browser requests contain only the scenario ID, attempt ID, contiguous turn, and
bounded user text. In Messaging mode, a draft is sent for reply preparation
only after five seconds without keyboard input; it does not advance the
canonical turn. Client-supplied persona replies, scores, XP, gates, outcomes,
and leaderboard values are rejected.

## Local persistence

The MVP stores no secrets and uses only:

- `rizzcode.v1.profile`
- `rizzcode.v1.progress`
- `rizzcode.v1.attempts`
- `rizzcode.v1.milestones`

At most 100 attempts are retained. A malformed record resets only itself. If
storage is unavailable, practice continues in memory with a visible warning.
The canonical active conversation store remains process-local for this
comparison build. A durable multi-instance deployment still needs a shared
store adapter.

## Deliberately outside this MVP

Authentication, Supabase, TinyFish, profile scraping, voice, avatars, video,
live humans, automated messages, Elo ratings, a real global leaderboard, course
infrastructure, attractiveness scoring, therapy, and attachment diagnosis are
not included.
